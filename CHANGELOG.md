  - Updated UI with collapsible headers and icons (â–¼/â–²) to indicate section state.
  - Added CSS for smooth collapse/expand animation using `max-height` and `opacity`.
  - Improved space efficiency for a better mobile experience.

### Changed
- **Improved Mobile Layout for Weekly Session Chart:**

- **Enhanced Session Page with Timer Improvements, Submission Handling, and Dynamic Positioning:**
  - Made timer size consistent with form content by setting `min-width` of `.session-form` and `.timer-container` to `300px`, and increased `.timer-circle` size to `150px`.
  - Added a better timer completion indicator with a `timerFinished` state, green background, pulse animation, and checkmark icon.
  - Prevented multiple clicks on the "Save Session" button using an `isSubmitting` state, showing a "Saving..." message and styling the disabled state with a grey background.

### Fixed

    - Ensured graph updates on week navigation with `selectedWeekStart` dependency.
    - Adjusted y-axis scaling to dynamically set the max value.
    - Added logging for invalid session dates.
  - Updated the "Current Week" button in `dashboard.tsx` and `globals.css`:
    - Set button to blue (`#1e90ff`) on the current week, grey (`#555`) on past weeks.
    - Added hover effect: grey to blue (`#1e90ff`), blue to darker blue (`#0077e6`).
    - Ensured the button remains clickable and jumps to the current week in all states.
  - Files: `src/pages/dashboard.tsx`, `src/styles/global.css`.
  - Issue: [#6](https://github.com/SmokeLog/SmokeLog/issues/6)
  - Commit: `feat: fix graph data and update Current Week button styling`

### Notes
- Version 1.1.1 introduces several UI enhancements and fixes, focusing on improving mobile usability, visual feedback, and space efficiency across the dashboard, session, and inventory pages.
- The footer addition provides consistent branding and navigation across all pages, with a tagline that may be made configurable in the future.
- **SemVer Note:** Some changes (e.g., issues #7, #8, #9, #10) include new features, which typically warrant a minor version bump (e.g., `v1.2.0`). These have been included in this patch release (`v1.1.1`) to align with the `v1.1.0` milestone.
